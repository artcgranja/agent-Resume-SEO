Resume - Wellington Granja

Profile

I am a young 41 years old leader, with more than 20 years‚Äô of extensive experience in fuel retail and tech companies in the private sector. I prefer to work where being with people is part of the dynamic, working with teams or in projects that require interaction with others. Additionally, I am able to develop trust and empathy with multiple stakeholders, and I can be very resilient, with a sharp problem solving approach to internal and external challenges.
